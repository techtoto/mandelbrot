# mandelbrot
[![Gradle CI](https://github.com/techtoto/mandelbrot/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/techtoto/mandelbrot/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This project visualizes the Mandelbrot set and has a couple of methods to "move around" in the complex number area of it.

The idea for this project comes from an exercise of "Allgemeine Informatik I" (gerneral informatics) at TU Darmstadt, where I study electrical engineering. Actually, the only exercise was to visualize the full Mandelbrot set and lots of code was already given, but I liked to expand this project.
Since I haven't very much experience in coding, especially in Java, my code might not be the best...


Last but not least, thanks to [NyCode](https://github.com/NyCodeGHG) for helping creating this repository and setting up Gradle. (She says Gradle is important, so it has to be true)
